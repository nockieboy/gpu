8-bit GPU Full Geometry unit test-bench command list.

This file contains a command list to drive Nockieboy's
8-bit GPU Geometry processor section.

******************************************************************************************************************

For a command to be accepted, it must have the 'at' symbol (SHIFT 2) in front of it.
Example:

[at]COMMAND_STRING <arg> <arg> <arg> ...

***Removing the [at] symbol means the command is ignored and it is treated as text comments.
Multiple commands are allowed on one line so long as each command has an [at] symbol in front of it.

******************************************************************************************************************
Commands: (*** No spaces allowed in any <FILE_NAME>)

[at]LOG_FILE  <FILE_NAME>            > Generates a results log file.         (No spaces allowed in file name).
[at]END_LOG_FILE                     > Forcefully closes/ends the log file.
[at]STOP                             > Stops the script processing/simulation.  Click on 'run -all' to continue script after the stop command.
[at]END                              > Ends the script processing/simulation. (You may now paint/set your own manual controls in the waveform view and run -all)

[at]LOAD_GPU_RAM <file_name.bin>     > Reads a binary file, up to 1 megabyte, into the GEO pixel-writer memory.  
[at]SAVE_GPU_RAM <file_name.bin>     > Saves GEO pixel-writer 1 megabyte memory into a binary file.
[at]CLR_GPU_RAM                      > Clears the GPU memory

[at]CLR_BMP      <color_byte>        > Clears the test geometry_plotter bitmap memory to a set byte.  (This is not the pixel writer)

[at]SAVE_GEO_BMP   <FILE_NAME> <width> <height> <1=B&W>            > Saves a 256 color BMP picture of the geometry_plotter's output, NOT GPU Ram. Max 2048x2048.  <1=B&W> or 0 for dummy 256 color palette
[at]SAVE_PIXIE_BMP <FILE_NAME> <src/dest> <width> <height> <1=B&W> > Saves a 256 color BMP picture of the pixie-writer system GPU memory. SET_PAGET settings must be set & PIXIE must be enabled prior to draw commands.  <1=B&W> or 0 for dummy 256 color palette

[at]RESET                            > Sends a reset to the geometry unit.
[at]ENA_PIXIE <0/1>                  > Enables/disables pixel writer.  (Pixel writer is disabled by default)
[at]WAIT_IDLE <0/1>                  > Waits for the all processes to finish whatever they are currently doing before running next command. IE 1 command at a time.

[at]SEND_CMD <h0000-hFFFF>           > send a raw command, 16 bit hex value

[at]SET_XY  <x/y> <0..3> <decimal>                             > Sets 12 bit register X or Y with 12 bit decimal value 0-4095, basically calls SEND_CMD with the right value.
[at]SET_PAGET <src/dest> <base_address_hex> <width> <depth>    > Sets PAGET's (pixel address generator) source/dest   memory address, image width, color depth in bits/pixel = (1/2/4/8/16).

[at]DRAW QUAD  <tlX> <tlY> <trX> <trY> <brX> <brY> <blX> <blY> <c> <f>  > Draws a quadrilateral, tl=Top Left, tr=Top Right, br=Bottom Right, bl=Bottom Left.
[at]DRAW ELLI  <Xc>  <Yc>  <Xr>  <Yr>  <c>   <q>   <f>                  > Draws an ellipse. Q=Quadrant.
                fill     = 0/1
                Quadrant = 0-3 to draw 1 of 4 quadrants.
                Quadrant = 4   to draw all 4 quadrants.

**** BLITTER must have PAGET (SRCE/DEST) set to function.

[at]BLIT TCOL  <transparent_color>         > [0.255]  Selects which color in the source image will be transparent when doing a paste when paste mask is enabled.
[at]BLIT SIZE  <px> <py> <width> <height>  > Sets the source image top left pixel position (px,py) and the copy (width,height) in pixels.
[at]BLIT ZOOM  <usX> <usY> <dsX> <dsY>     > Sets blitter zoom, us=upsample   float X/Y zooms up the SRCE image copy input   1.000000 to 4095.00000. (12 bit granularity)
                                                                ds=downsample float X/Y shrinks  the DEST image paste output 1.000000 to 0.000245.   (12 bit granularity)

[at]VWAIT  <#of frames> <video line#>        > Pause geometry processor until the #frames and video line# has been reached.
           Frames = 1 thru 15, 0 = no wait
           line   = 0 thru 255               > (There is a hidden multiplier for line (1,2,4,8) to support video modes up to 2040 lines.  Not supported in this demo.)
