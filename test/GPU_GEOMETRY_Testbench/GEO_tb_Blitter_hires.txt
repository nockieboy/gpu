8-bit GPU Full Geometry unit test-bench command list.

Written by Brian Guralnick.
Feb 01, 2021.

This file contains a command list to drive Nockieboy's
8-bit GPU Geometry processor section.

******************************************************************************************************************

For a command to be accepted, it must have the 'at' symbol (SHIFT 2) in front of it.
Example:

[at]COMMAND_STRING <arg> <arg> <arg> ...

***Removing the [at] symbol means the command is ignored and it is treated as text comments.
Multiple commands are allowed on one line so long as each command has an [at] symbol in front of it.

******************************************************************************************************************
Commands: (*** No spaces allowed in any <FILE_NAME>)

[at]LOG_FILE  <FILE_NAME>            > Generates a results log file.         (No spaces allowed in file name).
[at]END_LOG_FILE                     > Forcefully closes/ends the log file.
[at]STOP                             > Stops the script processing/simulation.  Click on 'run -all' to continue script after the stop command.
[at]END                              > Ends the script processing/simulation. (You may now paint/set your own manual controls in the waveform view and run -all)

[at]LOAD_GPU_RAM <file_name.bin>     > Reads a binary file, up to 1 megabyte, into the GEO pixel-writer memory.  
[at]SAVE_GPU_RAM <file_name.bin>     > Saves GEO pixel-writer 1 megabyte memory into a binary file.
[at]CLR_GPU_RAM                      > Clears the GPU memory

[at]CLR_BMP      <color_byte>        > Clears the test geometry_plotter bitmap memory to a set byte.  (This is not the pixel writer)

[at]SAVE_GEO_BMP   <FILE_NAME> <width> <height> <1=B&W>            > Saves a 256 color BMP picture of the geometry_plotter's output, NOT GPU Ram. Max 2048x2048.  <1=B&W> or 0 for dummy 256 color palette
[at]SAVE_PIXIE_BMP <FILE_NAME> <src/dest> <width> <height> <1=B&W> > Saves a 256 color BMP picture of the pixie-writer system GPU memory. SET_PAGET settings must be set & PIXIE must be enabled prior to draw commands.  <1=B&W> or 0 for dummy 256 color palette

                fill     = 0/1
                Quadrant = 0-3 to draw 1 of 4 quadrants.
                Quadrant = 4   to draw all 4 quadrants.
