Ellipse draw function table.
For a draw comand to be accepted, it must have the 'at' symbol (SHIFT 2) in front of it.
Example:

[at]COMMAND_STRING <arg> <arg> <arg> ...

***Removing the [at] symbol means the command is ignored and it is treated as text comments.
Multiple commands are allowed on one line so long as each command has an [at] symbol in front of it.

******************************************************************************************************************
Commands:

Generates a results log file.
[at]LOG_FILE  <FILE_NAME>       (No spaces allowed in file name).
[at]END_LOG_FILE                 Forcefully closes/ends the log file


Run the 'ellipse_henerator.sv' DUT:

[at]DRAW_ELLI  <filled> <quadrant> <X_center> <Y_center> <X_radius> <Y_radius> <color byte>
                Filled   = 0-1.
                Quadrant = 0-3 to draw 1 of 4 quadrant.
                Quadrant = 4   to draw all 4 quadrants.


[at]SAVE_BMP <FILE_NAME>   > Saves a BMP picture.  (No spaces allowed in file name)
[at]CLR_BMP <color byte>   > Clears bitmap memory to a set byte.

[at]RESET                  > Sends a reset to the ellipse generator

[at]STOP                   > Stops the script processing/simulation.  Click on 'run -all' or
                             type 'run -all' in transcript to continue script after the stop command.

[at]END                    > Ends the script processing/simulation.
